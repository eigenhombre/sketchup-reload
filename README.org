#+TITLE: scan_plugins.rb

* Auto-reload Plugin

=scan_plugins.rb= is a plugin for the [[http://www.sketchup.com][SketchUp]] 3d drawing program.

The plugin monitors any given directory and looks for any changed
=.rb= files. When your code changes, it is reloaded into SketchUp
automatically. This means you can work in your own plugin directory,
and wonâ€™t need to restart SketchUp to test changes to your scripts.

I found the plugin-writing process somewhat frustrating because, in
order to install a new plugin, you typically have to quit SketchUp and
restart it. This is murder if you test continuously as you develop (as
we all do... right?). =scan_plugins= avoids this problem.

Caveat: because each file will be executed as soon as it is changed,
the Ruby files in the specified directory should consist ONLY of
SketchUp plugins! Put your Ruby-based disk cleanup programs,
WEP-cracking utilities, etc., elsewhere.

I have found this script indispensable while developing other plugins,
by greatly reducing the turnaround time for testing.

* Usage:

- Find the plugin directory for the version of SketchUp you're using.
  Call that the /install/ plugin directory.
- Decide where you want your personal, in-development plugins to live
  (NOT the /install/ plugin directory).  Call that the /working/ plugin directory.
- Change the =PATH= variable in =scan_plugins.rb= to the working plugin directory.
- Copy =scan_plugins.rb= to the install plugin directory.
- Start SketchUp.
- Edit and save the plugin files to your heart's content, reaping the
  fruits of your work automatically each time.
